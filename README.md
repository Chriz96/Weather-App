<h1> 🌥 [JS] Weather App</h1>
<h3> This project is created to show the consumption data of an external API on the weather </h3>
<hr>

<h3> Project Description 📖 </h3>
The project consumes 2 Apis, one that delivers the weather data and the other that delivers images based on search words.
<br>
When making a query about the current weather in a city, the following will be done:

* The background-image will be changed for an image related to the consulted city.
* The image of the panel where the search was made will be changed to one related to the time of the city.
* The data of the temperature in Celsius, current climate, humidity and wind speed will be delivered.

<h3> Pre-requisites 📋 </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
No pre-requisite, you just have to download the code.

 </ul>
 
<h3> Built with 🛠️</h3>

 * **JavaScript.**
 * **CSS3.**
 * **HTML5.**
 * **SweetAlerts.**
 * **BoxIcons.**

<h3> Observations 🔎</h3>

* The **Api-Key** that is currently there to demonstrate the operation of the project in the future could be disabled.
* If you use a browser extension that allows you to use "dark" mode, it may be that the "background-image" is not shown in the searches. This happened to me with "Night Eye" (Opera).
